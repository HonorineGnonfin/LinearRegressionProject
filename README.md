# LinearRegressionProject

In this project, we applied two approaches to solve the linear regression problem. The first
approach is normal equation. The second is QR factorization using classical gram-schmidt.
Several functions have been built to solve the problem at hand. With the end, the mean square
error is computed to compare the two approaches.
